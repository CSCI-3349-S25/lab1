# Lab 1

1. If you aren't sure whether you have `git` installed on your computer, [follow these directions for installing `git` on your computer](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). You might already have it installed, so be sure to check as described in these instructions.

2. Clone this GitHub repo to your own computer. If you're not sure how to do this, use the [GitHub desktop app](https://desktop.github.com) or use the command line as I showed you in class:

* Go to your repo and click the green Code button, then the copy button.
* Launch a terminal.
* Navigate to where you'd like to keep your repos for this class (e.g., ``~/Desktop/CSCI3349/``).
* Type ```git clone``` and then paste in what you copied, above.


3. Now, navigate in the file system to the folder on your computer where you cloned this repo, and you will see a file called ``ps1.html``. Double click on the file, which will launch it in your web browser, and then complete the assignment as described in the file.

4. You'll be submitting the completed assignment using GitHub. Again, if this is new to you, use the GitHub Desktop app or use the command line as I showed you in class: ``git add <filename>``, ``git commit -m "your comment"``, ``git push``.
